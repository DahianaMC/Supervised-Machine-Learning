# Supervised-Machine-Learning

## Challenge 17 Summary 
We used the imbalanced-learn library to resample the data and we build and evaluate logistic regression classifiers using the resampled data.  We used Oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, for undersample the data we used the cluster centroids algorithm and finally we used a combination approach with the SMOTEENN algorithm.

We did for each resample:
- Train a logistic regression classifier (from Scikit-learn) using the resampled data.
- Calculate the balanced accuracy score using balanced_accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics.
- Generate a confusion_matrix.
- Print the classification report (classification_report_imbalanced from imblearn.metrics).

In our report we will determine which model fot better our data set analyzing the balanced accuracy score, the confusion matrix and classification report.
